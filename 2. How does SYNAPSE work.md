## 2. How does SYNAPSE work?

Imagine observing a complex system—whether it’s a data center, a human body, or the night sky.

Individual events are easy to capture. **Understanding what they collectively mean is not.**

Most existing systems reduce reality into one of three shapes:

- **Logs** → flat records
- **Streams** → ordered sequences
- **Rules** → predefined if/then logic

SYNAPSE starts from a different assumption:

> Meaning emerges from relationships, not from events alone.

### The core mechanics

1. **Event ingestion with domain awareness**

   Every incoming event is normalized into a shared event model:

    - identity,
    - timestamp,
    - domain,
    - properties.

      This allows heterogeneous systems to coexist without forcing premature schema convergence.

2. **Graph construction as a living structure**

   Events are linked as edges are added:

    - causal,
    - temporal,
    - semantic,
    - inferred.

      The graph is not static—it evolves continuously as new events arrive.

3. **Pattern recognizers operate over the graph**

   SYNAPSE introduces **Pattern Recognizers** as a core abstraction:

    - Tree Pattern Recognizers (hierarchical causality),
    - Network Pattern Recognizers (distributed interactions),
    - Temporal Pattern Recognizers (recurrence, rhythm, decay).

   These recognizers don’t scan raw events—they evaluate **graph state**.

4. **Disconnected pattern detection**

   SYNAPSE can correlate:

    - similar subgraphs appearing in different places,
    - patterns repeating without direct links,
    - partial structures that only become meaningful when seen together.

   This is essential in domains where:

    - sensors fail,
    - data is delayed,
    - causality is indirect.
5. **Decision & synthesis layer**

   When a pattern is recognized, SYNAPSE can:

    - emit a synthesized event,
    - escalate a warning,
    - propose an action,
    - or feed another domain’s graph.

   Importantly, this is **explainable**:

    - which events,
    - which relationships,
    - which time window,
    - which recognizer.

### Why this is innovative

- It moves **from event processing to meaning processing**
- It replaces rigid pipelines with **adaptive graph reasoning**
- It bridges operational systems and scientific inquiry
- It works where data is incomplete, noisy, or cross-domain

### What can improve over time

- Domain-specific recognizer libraries
- Hybrid recognizers (symbolic + statistical)
- Visualization of evolving graph “motifs”
- Human-in-the-loop pattern validation

This makes SYNAPSE not a finished product, but **a foundational platform**.
