## How Does SYNAPSE Work?

Imagine observing a complex system—whether it’s a data center, a human body, or the night sky.

Individual events are easy to capture.

**Understanding what they collectively mean is not.**

Most systems reduce reality into one of three shapes:

- **Logs** → flat records
- **Streams** → ordered sequences
- **Rules** → predefined reactions

SYNAPSE starts from a different premise:

> Meaning is not observed. It is derived.

### 2.1 Event ingestion as semantic leaves

All externally observed events enter SYNAPSE as **leaf nodes**.

Each event is normalized into a shared, immutable model:

- identity
- timestamp
- domain
- properties

These events represent **raw facts**, not conclusions.

They do not explain anything on their own.

Higher-level meaning is **never ingested directly**.

---

### 2.2 Bottom-up graph construction

SYNAPSE constructs a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** using a bottom-up approach.

Edges do not represent causality or control flow.

They represent **semantic contribution**.

When multiple events together satisfy a logical, temporal, or structural condition, SYNAPSE **derives a new event** that summarizes their shared meaning.

That derived event:

- becomes a **semantic parent** of its contributors
- is added as a new node in the graph
- may itself participate in further derivations

Over time, the graph grows **upward**, forming explicit semantic layers.

---

### 2.3 Promoted parents and semantic context

Derived events are **promoted** to first-class nodes.

Once promoted, they:

- summarize lower-level events
- define new semantic context
- act as hubs for related activity
- enable reuse of previously derived meaning

This promotion mechanism allows SYNAPSE to reason **incrementally**, rather than re-evaluating raw events repeatedly.

---

### 2.4 Pattern recognizers operate on semantic structure

SYNAPSE introduces **Pattern Recognizers** as structural observers of the EventNetwork.

Recognizers do not scan event streams.

They evaluate **semantic topology**, including:

- derivation levels
- shared ancestry
- recurring structures
- disconnected but similar subgraphs

Recognizers may operate across:

- multiple domains
- multiple semantic layers
- incomplete or delayed data

Recognition is not an endpoint—it **changes the network** by producing new derived events.

---

### 2.5 Semantic propagation and memory

As meaning accumulates, SYNAPSE maintains memory of:

- derivation paths
- semantic levels
- shared contexts

Traversal is **level-aware**, not just graph-aware.

This allows SYNAPSE to recognize:

- peer relationships (siblings, cousins)
- evolving situations
- stable semantic states

Memory in SYNAPSE tracks **how meaning emerged**, not just what happened.

---

### 2.6 Synthesis and action

When patterns stabilize, SYNAPSE may:

- emit additional derived events
- expose semantic state to external systems
- trigger agents or workflows

Crucially, actions are **downstream consumers** of semantic derivation—not the core of the system.

Every synthesis remains explainable:

- which events contributed
- through which derivation paths
- at which semantic levels
- by which recognizers

---

### 2.7 Why this matters

SYNAPSE moves:

- from event processing → **meaning processing**
- from pipelines → **semantic networks**
- from causality → **derivation**
- from reactions → **accumulated understanding**

It works where data is:

- incomplete
- noisy
- delayed
- cross-domain

---

### 2.8 A foundational platform

SYNAPSE is not a closed solution.

It is a platform for building systems that **accumulate meaning over time**, enabling:

- domain-specific recognizers
- hybrid symbolic/statistical reasoning
- long-lived semantic contexts
- human-in-the-loop interpretation

SYNAPSE does not just process events.

**It builds understanding.**
