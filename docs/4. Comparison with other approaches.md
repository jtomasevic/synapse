## 1. Logs & Observability Systems

### Dominant solutions / concepts

- Log aggregation (ELK, Splunk)
- Metrics & tracing (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
- Alerting systems (thresholds, simple correlations)

### Conceptual model today

- Events are **flat records**
- Relationships are inferred post hoc
- Meaning is derived from **volume, frequency, or thresholds**

### Limitations

- Poor understanding of causality
- Weak at recognizing *recurring failure structures*
- Cross-system correlations are manual or heuristic

### SYNAPSE differentiation

- Treats logs as **nodes in a causal graph**
- Recognizes **structural failure motifs**, not just spikes
- Supports disconnected-but-repeating incident patterns

### Comparison Table

| Dimension | Traditional Observability | SYNAPSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event model | Flat records | Graph nodes |
| Relationships | Implicit / inferred | Explicit, first-class |
| Pattern detection | Thresholds, heuristics | Structural motifs |
| Cross-system reasoning | Limited | Native |
| Explainability | Metric-based | Structure-based |
| Disconnected patterns | Not supported | Core capability |

**Key distinction:**

> Observability tools ask “what is noisy?”
>
>
> SYNAPSE asks *“what structure is forming?”*

Across all eight domains, the comparison is consistent:

- Existing solutions optimize **detection, prediction, or aggregation**
- SYNAPSE introduces **structure as the primary unit of meaning**
