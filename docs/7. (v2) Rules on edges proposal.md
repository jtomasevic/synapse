## Context

Put multiple rules on event node edge. Rules will have expression (interface already defined). Each rule will be evaluated, 
and then rule will decide if to create new event, ignore, connect with already existing node...
In this way we simulate neuron->axion->synapse behavior.

## Claim

> Edges comprise executable logic capable of mutating graph state independently of a centralized controller.


## Core change

> Edges become active semantic transitions, not passive links.

Each edge:

- observes its source event
- evaluates one or more expressions
- decides **how information propagates**
- may:
    - create a new event
    - reinforce an existing one
    - ignore
    - propose a connection

This is **exactly how synapses behave**:

- not every impulse passes
- some strengthen
- some fade
- some trigger plasticity

This analogy **holds structurally**, not just metaphorically.

## Rule scope must be explicit
Each edge rule should answer one question:
> “Given this source event, should and how should information cross this edge?”

- Not:
  - global optimization
  - business logic 
  - orchestration

- More like:
  - gating
  - transformation 
  - reinforcement

## Does this truly simulate neuron → axon → synapse?

**Yes, structurally**, but only in this sense:

| Biology | EventGraph |
| --- | --- |
| Neuron | Event |
| Axon | Outgoing edges |
| Synapse | Edge + rule |
| Neurotransmitter | Props / context |
| Plasticity | Rule thresholds / reinforcement |

> We are not simulating brains — we are borrowing a proven information propagation model.

## Conceptual shift

> We are moving from Topological Observation to Active Topology (the graph is the engine)

- Old model: Graph is data, engine reasons about it
- New model: Graph is the computation substrate

> This is not just metaphorical — it’s architectural.

## Synapse as “gatekeeper with memory”

- Key agreement:
  - Edge ≠ pipe
  - Edge = conditional propagator
  - Edge has state (even if minimal)


## **One-Sentence Examiner Anchor**

> Unlike CEP systems that evaluate predefined rules over event streams, machine-learning systems that infer statistical anomalies, or graph databases that store static relationships, SYNAPSE operates on evolving, domain-aware event graphs to recognize recurring structural and temporal patterns — including disconnected patterns — and to synthesize new events in a non-predictive, explainable manner.

Placing rules on edges represents a shift from **passive graph modeling** to **active topological computation**.

Edges become semantic propagation points that decide *if and how* information flows, rather than merely recording relationships.

This is structurally analogous to synapses in biological systems — not as a simulation of brains, but as a proven model for **localized, conditional signal propagation with memory**.

The value of this approach lies in:

- **local reasoning instead of global rule evaluation**
- **emergent patterns formed through repeated activation**
- **cross-domain correlation without predefined orchestration**

However, this power requires discipline:

- edge rules must be **bounded in scope**
- allowed outcomes must be **limited and declarative**
- propagation must be **rate-limited, traceable, and monotonic**

With these constraints, “active edges” become a defensible, implementable innovation that:

- differentiates EventGraph from CEP, graph databases, and workflow engines
- enables discovery of recurring, even disconnected, structural patterns
- preserves explainability through explicit causal paths

This is not unsupervised machine learning; it is **structure-driven emergence** — a new class of event reasoning systems where meaning arises from topology, repetition, and propagation, rather than centralized inference.
