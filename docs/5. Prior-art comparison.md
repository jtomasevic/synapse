# Prior Art Comparison and Inventive Distinction

## Technical field

The disclosed invention relates to **computer-implemented systems for event processing, pattern recognition, and state derivation**, and more specifically to systems that **derive semantic meaning from events through bottom-up graph-based abstraction**.

---

## Limitations of existing approaches (prior art)

### Event logging and stream processing systems

Known systems represent events as:

* flat logs,
* ordered streams,
* or windowed sequences.

These systems process events **linearly and temporally**, and typically:

* discard events after processing,
* maintain only transient operator state,
* or rely on predefined thresholds or rules.

**Limitation:**
Such systems do not retain derived semantic context as reusable entities and cannot incrementally build higher-order meaning across multiple abstraction layers.

---

### Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines

CEP systems detect patterns within bounded time windows using declarative rules.

While CEP engines may correlate multiple events, they:

* evaluate patterns episodically,
* emit results without structural persistence,
* and do not promote detected patterns into reusable graph entities.

**Limitation:**
CEP systems detect *occurrences* but do not construct a persistent semantic model that accumulates meaning over time.

---

### Workflow engines and rule-based systems

Workflow and rule engines model:

* predefined control flows,
* explicit state machines,
* or reactive condition-action logic.

These systems operate **top-down**, assuming prior knowledge of all relevant states and transitions.

**Limitation:**
They cannot derive new semantic states dynamically from previously unknown event combinations.

---

### Statistical, machine-learning, and predictive systems

Analytical and machine-learning systems:

* transform events into feature vectors,
* produce probabilistic outputs or predictions,
* and require retraining or re-evaluation when conditions change.

**Limitation:**
Such systems do not preserve explainable derivation paths and do not construct interpretable semantic layers within the event structure itself.

---

### Causal and provenance graphs

Causal graphs and provenance systems explain:

* why an outcome occurred, or
* how data was produced.

They are typically static, descriptive, and focused on **historical explanation**.

**Limitation:**
They do not support incremental semantic abstraction or reuse of derived meaning as an active computational entity.

## Inventive concept of SYNAPSE

The present invention introduces a **semantic derivation network** in which:

1. **All externally ingested events are leaf nodes**
2. **Derived events are created only through satisfaction of semantic conditions**
3. **Derived events are promoted to first-class parent nodes**
4. **Edges represent semantic contribution, not causality**
5. **The graph grows bottom-up, forming explicit derivation levels**
6. **Traversal is level-aware and context-preserving**
7. **Derived semantic states persist and participate in further derivations**

This model enables **incremental construction of meaning**, rather than episodic detection or reactive processing.

---

## Technical effects and advantages

Compared to prior art, the disclosed system achieves the following technical effects:

* persistent semantic memory without replaying event streams
* reduced recomputation by reusing derived abstractions
* explainable reasoning via explicit derivation paths
* robustness to incomplete, noisy, or delayed data
* cross-domain reasoning without schema unification
* level-aware pattern recognition (peer, sibling, cousin relationships)

These effects are achieved through **graph-based semantic promotion**, not through conventional rule evaluation or statistical inference.

---

## Non-obviousness

The combination of:

* immutable event ingestion,
* bottom-up derivation,
* promotion of derived events to parents,
* and level-aware semantic traversal

is **not suggested** by existing event processing, CEP, workflow, or analytical systems.

In particular, prior systems:

* do not treat derived meaning as a reusable graph entity,
* do not invert parent/child semantics for semantic abstraction,
* and do not accumulate meaning as a structural property of the system.

---

## Distinction from causal explanation systems

The disclosed invention does **not** model causality or control flow.

Instead, it models **semantic derivation**, answering:

> *What do these events mean together?*

This distinction fundamentally alters:

* graph structure,
* traversal semantics,
* memory requirements,
* and pattern recognition mechanisms.
