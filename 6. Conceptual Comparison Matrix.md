## **Master Conceptual Comparison Matrix**

### (CEP vs ML vs Graph DB vs SYNAPSE)

This table is adjust for **examiners, reviewers, and investors**, because it clearly shows *category separation*.

| Dimension | CEP / Rule Engines | ML / Anomaly Detection | Graph Databases | **SYNAPSE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary unit | Event stream | Feature vector | Nodes & edges | **Event graph** |
| Time handling | Windowed | Implicit / statistical | Weak / external | **First-class** |
| Structure awareness | Limited | None | Static | **Dynamic, evolving** |
| Pattern type | Predefined rules | Statistical deviations | Query-defined | **Structural + temporal** |
| Disconnected patterns | Not supported | Poor | Not native | **Native capability** |
| Cross-domain reasoning | Weak | Limited | Manual | **Core feature** |
| Explainability | Rule-based | Low / opaque | Query-based | **Graph + pattern trace** |
| Event synthesis | Rule-triggered | Not applicable | Not applicable | **Pattern-driven** |
| Predictive dependency | No | Yes | No | **No (non-predictive)** |
| Scientific suitability | Low | Limited | Moderate | **High** |
| Category | Automation | Prediction | Storage | **Event Intelligence** |

## **One-Sentence Examiner Anchor**

> Unlike CEP systems that evaluate predefined rules over event streams, machine-learning systems that infer statistical 
> anomalies, or graph databases that store static relationships, SYNAPSE operates on evolving, 
> domain-aware event graphs to recognize recurring structural and temporal patterns — including disconnected patterns — 
> and to synthesize new events in a non-predictive, explainable manner.
