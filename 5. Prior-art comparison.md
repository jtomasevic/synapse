# **Prior-Art Comparison (Patent-Oriented Compression)**

### Field of the Invention (context)

Existing systems that process events fall into several established categories: log aggregation, event streaming, workflow engines, rule-based correlation, statistical signal analysis, predictive modeling, and machine-learning–based anomaly detection. These systems operate primarily on **linear, statistical, or predefined logical representations** of events.

### Representative Prior Art Categories

1. **Log & Observability Platforms**

   Treat events as flat records or metrics; correlations are threshold-based or heuristic.

2. **Event Streaming & Event Sourcing Systems**

   Model events as immutable sequences; meaning is reconstructed through projections or replay.

3. **Workflow / BPM / ITSM Systems**

   Encode predefined process flows and escalation rules; deviations are handled externally.

4. **Statistical & Signal-Processing Systems (Scientific Domains)**

   Analyze time-series signals independently or via correlation; structural relationships are implicit or absent.

5. **Predictive & Machine Learning Systems**

   Optimize for classification or prediction accuracy; internal reasoning is opaque and non-structural.

6. **Graph Databases / Static Network Models**

   Store relationships but lack temporal pattern recognition, event synthesis, and domain-aware reasoning.


### Limitations of Prior Art (Shared Across Domains)

Across these categories, prior art systems generally:

- Treat **events as isolated records or ordered streams**
- Lack **native representation of evolving event networks**
- Do not recognize **recurring structural patterns over time**
- Fail to reason across **disconnected or partially observed events**
- Emphasize **prediction, aggregation, or detection**, rather than structural discovery
- Provide limited **explainability grounded in relationships**

### Distinguishing Characteristics of SYNAPSE

SYNAPSE introduces a unified approach in which:

- Events are first-class **graph nodes with domain identity**
- Relationships form **dynamic trees, DAGs, and networks**
- **Pattern recognizers** operate on graph structure and temporal recurrence
- **Disconnected structural patterns** are detectable and meaningful
- Recognized patterns may **generate new events**, within or across domains
- The system is **non-predictive and explainable by design**

This combination is not disclosed or suggested by existing prior art, either individually or in combination.

## Patent-Level Differentiation Summary

Unlike prior art systems that process events as records, streams, or statistical signals, SYNAPSE operates on **evolving, domain-aware event graphs** and evaluates **structural and temporal patterns**, including those formed by **disconnected or partially observed events**. The system recognizes recurring event trees and networks across time and domains and may synthesize new events as a result of recognized structures, without relying on predictive modeling. This structural, explainable, non-predictive approach to event intelligence is not disclosed or implied by existing log analytics, event sourcing, workflow engines, statistical analysis systems, machine learning frameworks, or graph databases.
