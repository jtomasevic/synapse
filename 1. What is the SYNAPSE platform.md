## 1. What is the SYNAPSE platform?

**SYNAPSE** is a cross-domain event intelligence platform that treats events not as isolated records or linear streams, but as **nodes in evolving, multi-domain graphs** whose meaning emerges from structure, relationships, and recurrence over time.

At its core:

- **Every event belongs to a domain**

  A domain defines semantic context (e.g. infrastructure, finance, biology, astronomy), but domains are *not silos*. Events can be linked across domains, enabling causality chains and pattern recognition that cross traditional system boundaries.

- **Events form graphs, not just streams or trees**

  Events can be connected as parents, children, siblings, causal links, correlations, or abstract relationships—resulting in trees, DAGs, or full networks.

- **Synapse evaluates complex network expressions**

  When a new event arrives, SYNAPSE evaluates it against:

    - structural conditions (graph topology),
    - temporal constraints (time windows, recurrence),
    - semantic constraints (event types, domains),
    - and historical context.

      The outcome can be:

    - a warning,
    - a recommendation,
    - or the **generation of a new event**, either in the same domain or a different one.
- **Pattern recognition is first-class citizens**

  SYNAPSE recognizes:

    - event trees (hierarchical causality),
    - event networks (many-to-many interactions),
    - repeated patterns across time windows,
    - patterns that span multiple domains.
- **Disconnected patterns are explicitly supported**

  SYNAPSE can detect meaningful patterns even when:

    - events are not directly connected,
    - causality is incomplete,
    - signals are sparse or noisy.

      This is critical for scientific discovery, early-warning systems, and real-world systems where full observability does not exist.

- **Non-predictive by design**

  SYNAPSE does not “predict the future.”

  It **discovers structure, recurrence, and relationships** in what has already occurred and what is currently unfolding—making it suitable for scientific, regulatory, and high-stakes environments where explainability matters.
