## 3. Where is SYNAPSE applicable? (Consolidated use cases)

Below is a unified structure for applicability, as requested.

---

### 1. Logs & Observability Systems

**How**

Model logs as events in a graph instead of flat entries.

**What we have today**

- Log aggregation
- Metrics dashboards
- Alert thresholds

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Detects structural failure patterns, not just spikes
- Correlates distributed symptoms
- Recognizes recurring failure motifs across systems

---

### 2. Event Sourcing & Business Processes

**How**

Treat business events as a causal graph rather than a replayable log.

**What we have today**

- Event streams
- Projections
- Read models

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Recognizes unhealthy process shapes
- Detects divergence from intended flows
- Works across bounded contexts

---

### 3. Infrastructure & Incident Management

**How**

Link infra signals, deploys, alerts, and human actions into one graph.

**What we have today**

- Rule-based alerts
- Postmortems after the fact

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Early recognition of incident formation
- Cross-team, cross-system visibility
- Pattern reuse across incidents

---

### 4. Earthquake Precursor Research (Scientific, Non-Predictive)

**How**

Model seismic, electromagnetic, and geological signals as a graph of events.

**What we have today**

- Statistical correlation
- Isolated signal analysis

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Identifies recurring precursor *structures*
- Works with incomplete data
- Supports explainable scientific hypotheses

---

### 5. Star Constellation Evolution & Astrophysics Research

**How**

Represent stellar events and spatial relationships as evolving graphs.

**What we have today**

- Static catalogs
- Manual analysis

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Tracks constellation topology changes
- Recognizes rare structural transitions
- Enables long-horizon pattern discovery

---

### 6. Cybersecurity & Threat Detection

**How**

Link authentication, network, and behavioral events across domains.

**What we have today**

- Signature-based detection
- ML anomaly scores

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Detects attack *shapes*, not signatures
- Correlates slow-burn attacks
- Fully explainable

---

### 7. Biology & Systems Medicine

**How**

Model biological signals, interventions, and responses as event networks.

**What we have today**

- Isolated biomarkers
- Statistical models

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Captures systemic interactions
- Supports hypothesis generation
- Works across scales

---

### 8. Traffic, Climate, and Urban Systems

**How**

Integrate sensor, human, and environmental events into shared graphs.

**What we have today**

- Forecasting models
- Dashboards

**Why SYNAPSE is better**

- Reveals structural stress patterns
- Cross-domain correlation (weather + traffic + behavior)
- Non-predictive but actionable insights

---

## Final synthesis

What makes **SYNAPSE** truly different is not any single feature—it’s the **combination**:

- Graph-native thinking
- Pattern recognition as a first-class concept
- Cross-domain, explainable reasoning
- Support for disconnected and incomplete reality
